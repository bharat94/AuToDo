# AuToDo
Somebody who is tired of all chores and wants a bed appearing splitting the earth just so they could sleep, needs to use our android application and click one button. The app finds everything it can do on their to-do list and simply does it. For example, all the items to be bought on the list are automatically ordered, all emails to be sent are typed and sent.

How we built it
We built an android application, using android-studio, coding in java.For the to-do list, we integrated with Evernote API. To implement the language parsing, we used Alchemy, that's hosted by bluemix IBM. For the email sending, we used Gmail Background Library. We searched for a name that matches the contact and obtained their email ID so we could send them a mail as expected.
